One of the biggest things I found myself repeating was creating components that
work with paged data sets. There are great examples of working with paged
tables in the Angular Material documentation, but in projects that manage lots
of different types of table data I used to duplicate a lot of code and
functionality creating paged table components for each type of data object I
had. Additionally, there are only examples of paging tables of data, but there
are other things that can be paged as well. This includes lists and grids, and
probably other things I can't think of right now (if I do I will add those and
their corresponding components).
