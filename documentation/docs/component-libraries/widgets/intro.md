# Introduction

The widgets library contains components built on top of the Angular Material
library. The Angular Material library is amazing, but there are some things
I continually found myself doing over and over again in my applications while
working with the library. This library is the result of me trying to simplify
certain tasks and functionality (i.e. make developing applications easier),
and to DRY up my client side code bases across all of my projects in the
seemingly endless struggle to be the best developer I can be.

This library does provide some basic CRUD capabilities, and as a result I do
need to have a consitent way to manage data. So this library depends on the
[base-json](projects/base-json) library for interfacing with JSON API servers.
I recommend that you take a look at that library to see if that will work for
your project before you dig too deep into this library.
