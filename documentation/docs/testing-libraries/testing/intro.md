# Introduction

The Testing library is meant to make testing components and angular apps easier
when using components from libraries defined in this workspace. It is NOT a 
general purpose testing library that will work for every app since it relies on
the customized structure of components defined in this workspace. There are 
already general purpose testing libraries available (I leave it up to you to 
find and determine which one is best for your purposes should you decide to use
a different library), but I decided to create my own for this workspace since I
felt it gave me more leeway in how I wanted to structure my tests.
