# BaseJson

The BaseJson library contains the most basic structures needed for developing
libraries to interface with a RESTful JSON API. This library is intended to be
extended to provide full CRUD capabilities. The reason for creating this base
library is to provide flexibility to the widgets that utilize a JSON API


, and was created as a separate library so the
most basic structures can be used with the widgets library and the user can
utilize the type The json and json-api libraries
effectively extend this library to provide full CRUD capabilites. 
This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.0.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project base-json` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project base-json`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project base-json` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build base-json` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build base-json`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/base-json` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test base-json` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
