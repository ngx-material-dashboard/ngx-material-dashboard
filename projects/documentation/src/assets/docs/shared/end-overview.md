## Running unit tests

The command to run unit tests for the JSON libraries depends on what library you are running the tests for. To run the tests for the `base-json` library run `ng test base-json`, to run the tests for the `json` library run `ng test json`, and to run the tests for the `json-api` library run `ng test json-api`. Unit tests are executed via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
