## Install the Library

To install the library run the following command:

```
npm install @ngx-material-dashboard/base-json @ngx-material-dashboard/json-api
```

This will install the base-json library, which is a required dependency and
this library.

If you want to make use of the fixtures and mocks I created for karma tests you can also install the testing library:

```bash
npm install @ngx-material-dashboard/testing
```
