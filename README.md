# NgxMaterialDashboard

The NgxMaterialDashboard is an Angular workspace that contains several libraries
and an example project that demonstrates how to use those libraries (example
project to be added...). I have also included
[angularplayground.it](https://angularplayground.it/) with sandboxes so you can
see some examples for how to use components in the widgets library. 

## Documentation 
Check out the documentation for the workspace hosted on github-pages [here](https://ngx-material-dashboard.github.io/ngx-material-dashboard/).

## Running unit tests

To run all unit tests in the workspace you can run

```bash
npm test
```

This will run unit tests for all libraries/projects in the workspace without
watching for changes in the libraries (i.e. no re-runs of tests if you make any
code changes). If you are developing for one or more of the libraries and you
want to run tests with `--watch` enabled, then I suggest using the `ng test`
command with the corresponding library name (i.e. `ng test base-json`).
