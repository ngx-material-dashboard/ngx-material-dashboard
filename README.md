# NgxMaterialDashboard

The NgxMaterialDashboard is an Angular workspace that contains several libraries and an example project that demonstrates how to use those libraries (example project to be added...). I have also included [angularplayground.it](https://angularplayground.it/) with sandboxes so you can see some examples for how to use components in the widgets library.

## Documentation 
For details on installation, configuration, and usage for each of the libraries available check out the documentation [here](https://ngx-material-dashboard.github.io/ngx-material-dashboard/).
