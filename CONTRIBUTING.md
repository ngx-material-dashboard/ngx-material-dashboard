# Contributing

Currently I am the only developer contributing to this project, and since this
is my first open source project I do not have any specific guidelines for how
to contribute at this time. If you find a bug and want to fix it or want to add
something you feel might be useful, then open an issue and we can discuss how
to go about doing that. The only thing I really request right now is that you
write good clean code and that you include unit tests to ensure your code works
as expected. Also please check any existing issues/discussions before you create
a new one to make sure you are not duplicating existing ones.

> NOTE: see my [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below about submitting bugs/issues.

## Disclaimer

This project is provided as is. I do hope to actively maintain and add to it as
I have time, but I am the only person working on it and I do have a full time
job that does not involve developing this project. So with that in mind, please
be aware that if you submit any bugs/issues for this project or any library
within, I most likely will not get to them in any sort of timely manner. That's
nothing against you, and I'm not saying that I wont' get to issues at all, it's
just that I have other things I have to work on that afford me the ability to
work on projects like this. And those do take priority since they actually pay
the bills. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.
